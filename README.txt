Block Matching Algorithms for Motion Estimation

This project contains the project report and source code by Aroh Barjatya for Digital Image Processing Class at Utah State University.

Following is a short description of the m files in this zip

motionsEstAnalysis.m  		Script to execute all Algorithms
motionEstES.m			Exhaustive Search Algorithm
motionEstTSS.m		Three Step Search Algorithm
motionEstNTSS.m		New Three Step Search Algorithm
motionEstSESTSS.m		Simple And Efficient Search Algorithm
motionEst4SS.m 		Four Step Search Algorithm
motionEstDS.m	 		Diamond Search Algorithm
motionEstARPSm		Adaptive Root Pattern Search Algorithm
costFuncMAD.m		Mean Absolute Difference Function
minCost.m			minimum cost among macro blocks
motionComp.m			motion compensated image creator
imgPSNR.m			finds image PSNR w.r.t. reference image


The 'caltrain' and several other test images can be found at 
http://www.cipr.rpi.edu/resource/sequences/sequence01.html

Many YUV test sequences can be found here http://trace.eas.asu.edu/yuv/

Please note that the accompanying paper and matlab code was written in 2004 when the author was a student at Utah State University. Since then the author has moved on to another research area and is not longer active in this field. 
Thus, please do not write any questions for help.
*Everything* needed to understand the code and techniques are either written as part of comments within the code, or within the PDF file.

I truly hope that this code is as much help to you as it was fun for me to write!
